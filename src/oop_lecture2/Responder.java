/**
 * The responder class represents a response generator object.
 * It is used to generate an automatic response, based on specified input.
 * Input is presented to the responder as a set of words, and based on those
 * words the responder will generate a String that represents the response.
 *
 * Internally, the reponder uses a HashMap to associate words with response
 * strings and a list of default responses. If any of the input words is found
 * in the HashMap, the corresponding response is returned. If none of the input
 * words is recognized, one of the default responses is randomly chosen.
